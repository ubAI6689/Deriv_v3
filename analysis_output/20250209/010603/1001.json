Additionally, the same row also has a very short trade duration (less than 1 minute), further supporting this conclusion.\n\nThe justification is based on data from `trades_past_day` and `trade_durationminutes`, specifically rows 72 and [71, 72] respectively. These datasets suggest that the user may be engaging in suspicious behavior, such as pretending to trade with short trades in quick succession using minimal amounts without significant profit or loss.\n\nNote: The risk level could also be classified as Medium if only one of these conditions was met, but given the combination of factors, High is the most appropriate classification.", "user_id": 1001}
